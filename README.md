Just the Claps
==============

Simple web interface for creating all-caps text with clap emojis between each word.

JSON Endpoint
-------------

So far, there's only one API endpoint, accessible at `/tr` or `/transform`. You can either send it a `GET` or `POST` request, with the parameters `text` and `symbol` representing the input text and the symbol to interject between words. If no symbol is provided, we assume you want... just the claps.

*Examples*

```
GET /tr?text=no%20war%20but%20the%20class%20war&symbol=%E2%98%AD
{"text": "NOâ˜­WARâ˜­BUTâ˜­THEâ˜­CLASSâ˜­WAR"}
```

```
POST /transform
{
	"text": "no you didn\'t",
	"symbol": "ðŸ˜ "
}

{"text": "NOðŸ˜ YOUðŸ˜ DIDN'T"}
```
